# Acknowledgements


The development of ICLS has benefited from many people. Its predecessors include Bendiks Jan Boersma (TU Delft), Wim-Paul Breugem (TU Delft), Pedro Costa (TU Delft), and Mehdi Niazi (KTH). Particularly, Mehdi provided his own code as a starting point of this project, and offered extensive technical support during the transition. The classical level set part of the code was implemented together with Jean-Christophe Loiseau (KTH), whose decisions have largely shaped the direction of the development. In addition, Michael Dodd (Uni. Washington), Olivier Desjardins (Cornell), and SÃ©bastien Tanguy (IMFT) are gratefully acknowledged for providing algorithmic help. Luca Brandt (KTH) and Outi Tammisola (KTH) oversaw the entire process.

The work is supported by the Microflusa project. This effort receives funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No. 664823. The signature of ICLS was made with an open-source application: http://www.kammerl.de/ascii/AsciiSignature.php.
